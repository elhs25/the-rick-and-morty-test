# The Rick & Morty test

## Frameworks

* NextJS or Vite
* Axios/Fetch

## Technologies

* Typescript
* CSS
* HTML
* Git

## Objective

The objective of this test is to assess your web development skills, using some of the most popular frameworks (**NextJS** or **Vite**) and technologies like **Typescript** or **Javascript**.

### Tasks

1. Create a website using the [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/), this website must contain two pages:
  * The first one must be a landing page, it should looks like this <img width="1300" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-24 at 14 02 53" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ee6610-8b60-4a26-a354-e120fc6d7730" />
  * The second one must be a *character details* page, this page is only accesible when user cliks on character's name, the URL should look like _www.EXAMPLE.com/{ID}_ where _{ID}_ is the character unique identifier available in the API. In this page you can include details like character's name, first appearance, location, status, specie, gender(if they have one) and their photo. This page could looks such as simple as this: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7201c494-fada-42c6-8696-e63275607aaf)
2. The landing page must include a **search bar**, this search bar should allow me to search any character available on the API, if there is no character found, the page should display a random message that says one of these quotes: 
  - >*Wubba Lubba Dub Dub! No characters found...*
  - >*Pero los discursos son para campañas. Ahora es tiempo de tomar acciones. No characters found...*
  - >*Deja de decirme que me relaje. ¿Alguna vez has tratado de relajarte? Es una paradoja. No characters found...*

## Deliverable

* Full source code

## Optional

* Prefer **Typescript** rather than **Javascript**.
* Upload the project to a free hosting, e.g: *Vercel*.
* Use **Tailwind CSS** instead of create your own styles.
* Responsive design.
* Localization support.
